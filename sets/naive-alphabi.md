# Naive Alphabinary Encoding

This was the Alphabinary ruleset used by the first test scripts to generate alphabinary-to-letter dictionaries.

It is very simple to implement (requiring code to only have a knowledge of 52 code points), making it suitable for ASCII-only text.

However, for any text containing any letter characters outside of the ASCII set (such as an accented "Ã©"), it is unsuitable, as it discards such characters entirely. (It also doesn't exhibit proper case-folding, which would cause some extended characters to transform into Latin characters.)

For handling such characters in a way that more closely resembles how a user familiar with only the Latin alphabet may interpret them (ie. ignoring the accents and interpreting them as the *unaccented* Latin letter they resemble), see [Superficial Alphabinary Encoding](superficial-alphabi.md).

## Procedure

Convert the text to lower case [(per the "lower-case-mapping" rule procedure)](../rules/lower-case-mapping.md).

Convert all letters from "a" to "m" to zero and all letters from "n" to "z" to 1 [(per the "latin" rule procedure)](../rules/latin.md).

Ignore all other code points [(per the "discard-rest" rule procedure)](../rules/discard-rest.md).
